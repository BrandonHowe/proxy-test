# Proxy test

I tried to make a proxy. This is my attempt at this. I've spent at least 6 hours on this and I think I'll put it to rest, at least until I pick it up again.

You can see my 2 different attempts to do this. First, I tried to do it by using a standard GET request on the server, but I used a shitty module and gave up on that. Then, I tried using a CORS bypasser, which doesn't actually work since I made it in the client. Whatever, it wouldn't work anyways.

This will just be left here for anyone else who wants to pick up the pieces I've made, as I haven't seen anything like this ever, frankly. The most similar thing I found was Google Translate, which isn't even that good.
